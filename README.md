# Crowd Fund App

This is a web3.0 based crowdfund web application created by using React, Tailwindcss, Solidity, and Thirdweb API.

## How to run:
1. Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: React is built with JavaScript, and Node.js is required to run the development server and build your project.
npm (Node Package Manager): This comes bundled with Node.js installations and allows you to install and manage dependencies.
You can check if you have them installed, and their versions, by running:

  node -v
  npm -v

2. Navigate to your React project directory:
If your React application is located in a directory named my-react-app, navigate to it with:

  cd path-to-your-react-app
Replace path-to-your-react-app with the actual path to your React application.

3. Install Dependencies:
If you haven't already installed the project's dependencies, or if you've just cloned the project from a repository, you'll need to install the required packages. You can do this with:

  npm install
This command looks at the package.json file in your project directory and installs the required dependencies listed there.

4. Run the React App:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server using:

  npm start
By default, this will launch your React application in development mode and open it in your default web browser. Typically, it'll be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

If the port 3000 is already in use, it may prompt you to use a different port.

5. Accessing the App:
As mentioned, the app will usually open automatically in your default browser. If not, you can manually open a browser and enter the address http://localhost:3000.
